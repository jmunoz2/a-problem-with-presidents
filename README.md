A Problem with Presidents; a data to information challenge.

Problem Statement:

The goal of this problem is to apply computer code to solve a problem from a givensimple data set and then further use computer code to communicate the results to stakeholders.

Using the given data I used javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, and Twitter Bootstrap to fetch and analize the data and provide the results in a webpage. I added buttons to allow stakeholders to save a generated reports. 

Variables used: 

year_of_birth, lived_years, lived_months, lived_days 

The webpage shows two well formatted output tables ranking the top 10 Presidents from longest lived to shortest lived and then the top 10 presidents from shortest lived to longest lived.

Using the newly created data, calculated the mean, weighted mean, median, mode, max, min and standard deviation of lived_days. 

The measures are shown on a separate table. 

Then, I made a plot of a type that you think best shows the distribution of this data.

Assemble your tables and plot into a single report with a title, author and date. Start the report with a 3 or 4 sentence summary of what you found, the body should have your tables and plot and any commentary about your methods or assumptions you think the reader would need to know. Finish the report with a conclusions section, where you state the conclusions you reached through this analysis.
